      Q1. First, could you please share your current designation & which
      department you are working under?<br />
      A: I am working in the General Medicine department.<br />
      <br />

      Q2. On average, how many hours do you work in a week? How often do you
      have to work night shifts or extended hours?<br />
      A: I work around 50 hours per week. I do not have night shifts, but I do
      have extended working hours 1-2 days a week. <br /><br />

      Q3. Have you worked under extreme conditions where you are working for
      over 24 hours without breaks? Do you think overworking affects your
      work-life balance? In what ways?<br />
      A: Yes, during training, I worked 24 to 36 hours without breaks.
      Overworking affects work-life balance as I am constantly on call, even
      during vacations, which makes it difficult to disconnect mentally.
      <br /><br />

      Q4. Do you feel that your workload has increased over time? If so, what do
      you think are the primary factors?<br />
      A: No, I have set strong boundaries for my working hours. However, in some
      fields like surgery or gynaecology, workload naturally increases due to
      the need for emergency care. <br /><br />

      Q5. Have you experienced any physical health issues due to OT (fatigue,
      weakness)? Mental health issues such as stress, burnout? How do you manage
      it?<br />
      A: Yes, overworking does impact both physical and mental health. The
      constant availability creates stress and fatigue. I manage it by setting
      work boundaries and delegating tasks when possible. <br /><br />

      Q6. In your opinion, does excessive workload impact patient care &
      decision-making? How?<br />
      A: Yes, excessive workload can lead to exhaustion, which may affect
      decision-making and patient care. A well-rested doctor can perform
      better.<br /><br />

      Q7. Are there any policies in your hospital to limit/reduce OT? Are they
      effective?<br />
      A: No, there are no specific policies for mandatory leaves or overtime
      restrictions. Doctors can choose to work as much as they want.<br /><br />

      Q8. Do you feel comfortable discussing work-related stress or overload
      with your colleagues/superiors?<br />
      A: Yes, we do discuss it, but ultimately, it is an individual choice
      whether to take on more work or set boundaries.<br /><br />

      Q9. Are there any counselling services/wellness programs to assist
      doctors? Does it help? Is it a good initiative?<br />
      A: No, there are no such wellness programs or counselling services
      available. <br /><br />

      Q10. What solutions/changes would you recommend to improve your working
      conditions?<br />
      A: Implementing automation for certain tasks, restricting patient access
      to personal numbers, increasing manpower, and introducing a structured
      five-day workweek would help improve working conditions.<br /><br />
