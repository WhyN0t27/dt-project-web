    Q1. First, could you please share your current designation & which
    department you are working under?<br /> A: I am a Critical Care Consultant working
    in the Medical ICU (Intensive Care Unit). <br /><br />
    
    Q2. On average, how many hours do you work in a week? How often do you have to work night shifts or extended
    hours?<br /> A: I work around 6-8 hours per day, six days a week, and sometimes on
    Sundays. Night shifts happen once a week, and extra hours depend on the
    workload.<br /><br /> 
    
    Q3. Have you worked under extreme conditions where you are working
    for over 24 hours without breaks? Do you think overworking affects your
    work-life balance? In what ways?<br /> A: Yes, I sometimes work 24-hour shifts,
    especially on Sundays. Overworking affects work-life balance, but I try to
    maintain a balance between personal and professional life. <br /><br />
    
    Q4. Do you feel that your workload has increased over time? If so, what do you think are the
    primary factors?<br /> A: Compared to my residency, my workload has decreased in
    terms of physical labour, but there is more mental work and responsibility
    now. <br /><br />
    
    Q5. Have you experienced any physical health issues due to OT (fatigue,
    weakness)? Mental health issues such as stress, burnout? How do you manage
    it?<br /> A: No, I have not experienced any physical or mental health issues due
    to overworking. <br /><br />
    
    Q6. In your opinion, does excessive workload impact patient
    care & decision-making? How?<br /> A: Yes, in general, excessive workload can
    impact patient care and decision-making, but I have not personally faced
    such issues in my workplace. <br /><br />
    
    Q7. Are there any policies in your hospital to limit/reduce OT? Are they effective?<br /> A: Yes, the hospital has a structured
    shift system that prevents overworking. Shifts are confined to eight hours,
    and night shifts last from 5 PM to 8 AM. There are no prolonged working
    hours. <br /><br />
    
    Q8. Do you feel comfortable discussing work-related stress or
    overload with your colleagues/superiors?<br /> A: Yes, I can communicate with my
    superiors about workload issues, and they are supportive in adjusting shifts
    if necessary. There are no workplace politics affecting this. <br /><br />
    
    Q9. Are there
    any counselling services/wellness programs to assist doctors? Does it help?
    Is it a good initiative?<br /> A: No, there are no counselling services or
    wellness programs available. <br /><br />
    
    Q10. What solutions/changes would you recommend
    to improve your working conditions?<br /> A: The current structured shift system
    is already effective in preventing excessive overworking, so no major
    changes are required.<br />
