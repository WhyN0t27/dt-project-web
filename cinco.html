    Q1. First, could you please share your current designation & which
    department you are working under?<br /> A: I am a consultant cardiologist in the
    Department of Cardiology.<br /><br /> 
    Q2. On average, how many hours do you work in a
    week? How often do you have to work night shifts or extended hours?<br /> A: I
    usually start work at 8 AM and finish at 5 PM, but sometimes I stay until 6
    or 7 PM. I have night shifts once a week and Sunday duty once every six
    weeks. <br /><br />
    Q3. Have you worked under extreme conditions where you are working
    for over 24 hours without breaks? Do you think overworking affects your
    work-life balance? In what ways?<br /> A: Yes, since my MD days, I have worked
    24-hour shifts where we come in the morning, work through the night, and
    leave the following afternoon or evening. I have gotten used to it, so I
    don't feel that it affects my work-life balance significantly. <br /><br />
    Q4. Do you
    feel that your workload has increased over time? If so, what do you think
    are the primary factors?<br /> A: Yes, always. As I gain more experience, my
    responsibilities increase. <br /><br />
    Q5. Have you experienced any physical health
    issues due to overwork? (Fatigue, weakness). Mental health issues such as
    stress, burnout? How do you manage it?<br /> A: No physical health issues so far.
    No mental health issues related to work either, since we are trained to
    handle such conditions from our MD period.<br /><br />
    Q6. In your opinion, does
    excessive workload impact patient care & decision-making? How?<br /> A: Up to 11
    PM or 12 AM, we can still make clear decisions, but after that, exhaustion
    sets in, which could affect decision-making. <br /><br />
    Q7. Are there any policies in
    your hospital to limit/reduce OT? Are they effective? <br />A: Technically, after
    a night shift, we are allowed to leave after morning rounds. However, due to
    additional work, we often stay 2-3 hours extra. <br /><br />
    Q8. Do you feel comfortable
    discussing work-related stress or overload with your colleagues/superiors?<br />
    A: I discuss with colleagues, but only sometimes with superiors. <br /><br />
    Q9. Are
    there any counselling services/wellness programs to assist doctors? Does it
    help? Is it a good initiative?<br /> A: No, there are no such programs. <br /><br />
    Q10. What
    solutions/changes would you recommend to improve your working conditions? A:
    Increasing the number of doctors and implementing shift-based work instead
    of 36-hour continuous shifts.<br /> A separate night shift system (starting in the
    evening and ending in the morning) could be a better alternative.<br /><br /> 
    Q11. When
    you overwork, do you get paid for it? Is there a policy regarding this?<br /> A:
    No, we don’t get paid for overtime. As consultants, we don’t have fixed
    working hours—sometimes, we can leave early if work is light. However,
    overworking is common, especially at the start of our careers.<br /><br /> 
    Q12. Do your
    superiors get paid for overtime?<br /> A: I don’t think so. They don’t do night
    duties, and these long shifts are only part of the early career phase.<br />
