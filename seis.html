    Q1. First, could you please share your current designation & which
    department you are working under?<br /> A: I am a consultant pathologist working
    in the Department of Laboratory Medicine. <br /><br />
    Q2. On average, how many hours do
    you work in a week? How often do you have to work night shifts or extended
    hours?<br /> A: I work around 48 hours per week, with six working days and
    eight-hour shifts per day. We don’t have formal night shifts, but we do have
    extended hours when needed—either arriving early for procedures or staying
    late for critical cases. <br /><br />
    Q3. Have you worked under extreme conditions where
    you are working for over 24 hours without breaks? Do you think overworking
    affects your work-life balance? In what ways?<br /> A: No, I haven’t worked a
    continuous 24-hour shift. However, overworking sometimes affects work-life
    balance, especially when work extends beyond shift hours. <br /><br />
    Q4. Do you feel
    that your workload has increased over time? If so, what do you think are the
    primary factors? A: Yes, workload has increased as I gained experience. The
    primary factors include increased responsibilities, more critical cases, and
    a growing patient load. 
    Q5. Have you experienced any physical health issues
    due to overwork? (Fatigue, weakness). Mental health issues such as stress,
    burnout? How do you manage it?<br /> A: Physically, back pain, neck pain, and eye
    strain are common due to long hours using the microscope. Mentally, I
    haven’t experienced major stress or burnout, as I enjoy my work. <br /><br />
    Q6. In your
    opinion, does excessive workload impact patient care & decision-making? How?<br />
    A: While we do our best, excessive workload can lead to fatigue and slower
    decision-making. Over time, this might affect efficiency and the quality of
    patient interactions. <br /><br />
    Q7. Are there any policies in your hospital to
    limit/reduce OT? Are they effective?<br /> A: Not that I’m aware of. <br /><br />
    Q8. Do you
    feel comfortable discussing work-related stress or overload with your
    colleagues/superiors?<br /> A: I feel comfortable discussing it with colleagues
    and family members, but not with superiors, as it could lead to workplace
    politics. <br /><br />
    Q9. Are there any counseling services/wellness programs to assist
    doctors? Does it help? Is it a good initiative?<br /> A: I am not sure, as I have
    only been here for six months and haven’t needed such services. <br /><br />
    Q10. What
    solutions or changes would you recommend to improve your working conditions?<br />
    A: There should be designated time for casual interactions among colleagues.
    This would help improve communication and teamwork, rather than mixing
    informal and formal interactions throughout the workday.<br />
