    Q1. First, could you please share your current designation & which
    department you are working under?<br /> A: I am a senior consultant urologist,
    andrologist, and renal transplant surgeon. <br /><br />
    Q2. On average, how many hours do
    you work in a week? How often do you have to work night shifts or extended
    hours?<br /> A: I work 60 to 70 hours a week. I am on call 24 hours a day, without
    a fixed roster. Even if I am not officially on call, I may receive emergency
    calls at any time. For example, last night I received a call at 2 AM
    regarding one of my patients. If needed, I would have come in. <br /><br />
    Q3. Have you
    worked under extreme conditions where you are working for over 24 hours
    without breaks? Do you think overworking affects your work-life balance?<br /> A:
    When I was a junior resident, I did work for over 24 hours continuously.
    Now, as a senior consultant, I have a team that assists with the initial
    patient work-up, so I do not work those extended shifts. However, my
    responsibilities have significantly increased. Work-life balance is
    affected, but over the years, I have adapted and learned to manage it. <br /><br />
    Q4.
    Do you feel that your workload has increased over time? If so, what do you
    think are the primary factors?<br /> A: Yes, my workload has increased, but not
    necessarily in terms of working hours. As a senior consultant, I am
    responsible for all decisions and surgeries. While junior doctors assist in
    preparing patients, I must personally oversee every detail and perform the
    surgeries myself. My role now involves more managing and decision-making in
    addition to performing surgeries.<br /><br /> 
    Q5. Have you experienced any physical or
    mental health issues due to overwork? How do you manage it?<br /> A: Physically,
    yes—there is tiredness and exhaustion, especially after long surgeries such
    as cadaver transplants, which typically happen at night. After such
    procedures, the next day feels dull and sluggish. In my early years, I
    recall operating all night and nearly dozing off while taking patient
    histories the next morning. Mentally, there is stress, but I have learned to
    manage it. Sometimes, taking a short break for 2-3 hours helps reset
    everything. However, I have never felt like leaving my work. At most, I
    might think about taking a break, like going for biryani. <br /><br />
    Q6. In your
    opinion, does excessive workload impact patient care & decision-making? How?<br />
    A: Yes, it does. If you are exhausted, your efficiency declines. However, we
    try to manage our time well to avoid errors. <br /><br />
    Q7. Are there any policies in
    your hospital to limit/reduce OT? Are they effective?<br /> A: There are no formal
    policies. However, as we gain experience, we learn to manage our workload
    better. If I am overworking without taking time for meals, it means I am not
    managing my time efficiently. Time management is critical in our profession.<br /><br />
    Q8. Do you feel comfortable discussing work-related stress or overload with
    your colleagues/superiors?<br /> A: Yes, overall, I manage fine. Sometimes, I may
    feel bad about excessive workload, but I do not dwell on it. <br /><br />
    Q9. Are there
    any counselling services/wellness programs to assist doctors? Does it help?<br />
    A: No, there are no formal counselling services. Some doctors may talk about
    attending sessions, but we rarely take that step. Possibly, there is a fear
    of being judged, especially at junior levels.<br /><br /> 
    Q10. What solutions/changes
    would you recommend to improve your working conditions?<br /> A: Increasing the
    number of junior doctors would help. A proper shift-based duty system (e.g.,
    working from 8 AM to 5 PM with a separate night shift) would be beneficial.
    In institutions, junior doctors have scheduled rotations, ensuring some
    personal time. If we could implement a similar system, it would improve
    overall well-being. <br /><br />
    Q11. When you overwork, do you get paid for it? Is there
    a policy regarding this?<br /> A: No, there is no overtime pay. However, we have
    some flexibility—if work is light, we can leave early. <br /><br />
    Q12. Do your
    superiors get paid for overtime?<br /> A: I don't think so. However, at a senior
    level, we do not have night shifts, so our workload is different compared to
    junior doctors.<br /><br />
