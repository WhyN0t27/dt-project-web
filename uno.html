      Q1. Could you please share your current designation and the department you
      are working in?<br />
      A: I am working as a junior resident in the Vascular Surgery
      Department.<br /><br />

      Q2. On average, how many hours do you work in a week? How often do you
      have to work night shifts or extended hours?<br />
      A: On paper, I am scheduled to work 8.5 hours per day, but in reality, I
      work around 9.5 hours daily. In some cases, my shifts extend to 12 or even
      13 hours, depending on emergency calls. While my official working hours
      total 208 hours per month, I actually work around 250 to 260 hours per
      month.<br /><br />

      Q3. Have you ever worked under extreme conditions, such as 24-hour shifts
      without breaks? Do you think overworking affects your work-life balance?
      If so, in what ways?<br />
      A: Yes, during my internship, I once worked for 72 hours straight. It is a
      common experience for intern doctors. Overworking significantly impacts my
      work-life balance—I have very little personal time and rarely get to spend
      time with my family, as most of my time is spent in the hospital.<br /><br />

      Q4. Have you experienced any physical or mental health issues due to
      overtime (fatigue, weakness, stress, burnout)? How do you manage it?<br />
      A: Yes, the lack of sleep and excessive workload often lead to exhaustion
      and muscle cramps. I work six days a week, and in case of emergencies, I
      sometimes have to work on Sundays as well.<br /><br />

      Q5. In your opinion, does excessive workload impact patient care and
      decision-making? If so, how?<br />
      A: While exhaustion and stress may affect my interactions with hospital
      staff, I always ensure that it does not impact the care and treatment I
      provide to my patients.<br /><br />

      Q6. Are there any policies in your hospital to limit or reduce overtime?
      If so, are they effective?<br />
      A: No, there are no such policies in my hospital, and to my knowledge,
      other hospitals do not have them either.<br /><br />

      Q7. Do you feel comfortable discussing work-related stress or overload
      with your colleagues or superiors?<br />
      A: Yes, I do share my concerns with my family and superiors. Sometimes, my
      superiors listen and make adjustments, while other times they do not. I
      consider myself fortunate to have supportive consultants.<br /><br />

      Q8. Are there any counseling services or wellness programs available to
      assist doctors? If so, do they help?<br />
      A: No, there are no such programs available. Additionally, overtime
      payments are often delayed or not provided at all, despite assurances that
      they will be paid.<br /><br />

      Q9. What solutions or changes would you recommend to improve working
      conditions for doctors?<br />
      A: Regular check-ins from supervisors would be beneficial. There should be
      mandatory discussions—either weekly or at least once every 15 days—where
      doctors can discuss their workload, the challenges they face, and any
      necessary improvements. Hospitals should establish a dedicated team to
      collect and address feedback from doctors.<br />
